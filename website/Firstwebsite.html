<font size="+1.5">I was born and raised in New York City. When I was a kid I always wanted to work with money and create my own business some day. When I turned 16 I started to get interested in computers and how they worked. I then bought books on html, css, and javascript. I then built my first website which was a big accomplishment for me. I ended up getting a passion for computers and why things like code work. I started to see people like Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, and Bill Gates who built there success off of their knowledge of computers. So now we come to the present were I now mixed my love for business/entrepreneurship and programming. I hope to one day create my own business based off of Deep learning and artificial intelligence.   </font>
